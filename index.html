            <div class="grid-item2 text"> In a little over 20 years something of a “public space movement” has taken hold. The value of New York City’s public built environment to urban life has become almost universally acknowledged across sectors and disciplines: design, public service, social and urban planning, real estate development, and more.
                It certainly was not always so. Twenty years ago, “public” was not a word that one associated with either space or design. Then, as now, New York’s public sector was full of talented designers, planners, and policymakers drawn to the great possibilities of designing the city’s libraries, esplanades, and parks. But the agenda was not supported.

            <div class="grid-item1 text"  >Many of the designs and strategies I look at developed first elsewhere, but New York provided a critical mass of projects, and visibility, which allowed them to be implemented quickly, and visibly. 

                The pandemic has brought renewed focus on public space as "social infrastructure", and a growing recognition that public space doesn't benefit everyone.
                <br>
                Also with growing understanding and influence of a healthier life, The presence of a park or green space in close proximity to a house can enhance the living conditions of the surrounding. People often prefer living near parks for the amenities they offer, such as recreational activities, green views, and a sense of community. It offers things that you might not get even living in the most palatial housing.

                <br>
                Private developers have learned that attractive public places (marketplaces, outdoor food courts and atria) are selling points with investors and community review boards, and marketing signatures of their projects. Meanwhile the new economy is successfully innovating models for sharing workplaces, transportation on demand, short term and apartment living, and industry. The appeal and acceptance of sharing and co-mingling is increasing, particularly in dense urban environments where start-ups flourish and their success can depend upon the efficient use of resources.

            <div class="grid-item2 text"> As I  saw a dis-propotionate number of of public spaces , projecting a sense of peoplehood and placemaking they also show a shift to serving the "economy" in the form of outdoor dining, and a fetishization of technical design solutions blanketing on the idea of providing the public a social green space.
                <br>
                I found one of the reasons for it could be the The 1961 Zoning Resolution inaugurated the POPS Program in New York City. It encouraged private developers to provide publicly accessible spaces, specifically plazas and arcades, on private property in exchange for bonus floor area in certain high-density districts.
                I further my research after finding some more intresting timelines in the way this built environment evolved like mushrooms.
                <br>
                What drove this shift, and what are the real contours of these changes?
                However, many mentioned a downside to significant public space improvements: When public and private investment delivers high-quality public space design and maintenance in low-income areas, property values rise and maybe even contributing to gentrification.

        <div class="grid-item2 text"> Brooklyn Bridge Park is a waterfront park located along the East River in Brooklyn, New York City. It spans 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) and covers approximately 85 acres (34 hectares) of land. The park offers stunning views of the Manhattan skyline, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the Statue of Liberty.
            <br>Before the development of Brooklyn Bridge Park, the area along the Brooklyn waterfront underwent significant transformations over the years.

        <div class="grid-item1 text"  > <br>The area now occupied, was once a bustling industrial waterfront. It was a major shipping and manufacturing hub, with warehouses, factories, and shipping piers dotting the shoreline. 
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item2 text"> The surrounding area had a mix of residential and industrial properties. The neighborhoods in proximity to the park include DUMBO (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass), Brooklyn Heights, and Fulton Ferry. Located just north of the park, Brooklyn Heights is a historic neighborhood known for its tree-lined streets and well-preserved brownstones. It has a mix of residential buildings, including townhouses, apartments, and co-op buildings. Many of the buildings in this neighborhood date back to the 19th century and reflect architectural styles from that era.

Since then, the park has been developed in phases, with new sections opening periodically. The park's design combines recreational spaces, greenery, and restored industrial features, blending natural and urban elements.
                Funding for the park comes from a combination of public and private sources, including the city, state, and federal governments, as well as donations and revenue generated through commercial leases within the park.
                Over the years, Brooklyn Bridge Park has become a popular destination for both residents and tourists, offering a vibrant and scenic public space for recreation, relaxation, and community gatherings.

            <div class="grid-item2 text"> The Domino Sugar Refinery, from which the park takes its name, was established in 1856 by the American Sugar Refining Company. The refinery complex expanded over time, becoming one of the largest sugar processing facilities in the world. It dominated the landscape and economy of the neighborhood for more than a century.
                <br>
                In the 20th century the Domino Sugar Refinery was a significant industrial operation throughout the 20th century, employing thousands of workers and producing large quantities of sugar products.
                The refinery ceased operations in 2004, marking the end of an era for the site and leaving a massive industrial space vacant along the East River waterfront.
                <br>
                Following the closure of the refinery, the redevelopment of the site began. In 2012, the property was acquired by Two Trees Management, a real estate development firm.
                the neighborhood surrounding the Domino Sugar Refinery was characterized by a working-class population, consisting of industrial workers, immigrants, and long-time residents.

                The vision for the site's transformation included preserving elements of the refinery complex while creating a vibrant mixed-use development that incorporated residential, commercial, and public space components. Today, Domino Park serves as a popular public space for residents and visitors. It features various amenities, including lawns, playgrounds, volleyball courts, a water feature, and a taco stand.

                <div class="grid-item2 text"> The High Line was built as part of the West Side Improvement Project, designed to alleviate street-level rail traffic in Manhattan's industrial district. The elevated railway was used to transport goods between factories, warehouses, and the city's waterfront. The first section of the High Line, known as the West Side Elevated Freight Railroad, opened in 1934. When the High Line was first constructed in the 1930s, the surrounding neighborhoods were primarily industrial areas. The district housed factories, warehouses, and manufacturing facilities, attracting a working-class population. Many of the residents were employed in the industrial sector and worked in the factories and businesses located in the area.

                <div class="grid-item1 text"  >Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, the neighborhoods around the High Line started to attract artists, musicians, and other creative individuals. The industrial buildings and lofts in the area provided affordable living and studio spaces, fostering a vibrant artistic community. Many artists were drawn to the area's unique character and the availability of large, open spaces for their work.
                    Over the years, the demand for rail freight transportation declined, and the High Line saw a decrease in usage. The last train ran on the High Line in 1980, and the rail structure gradually fell into disuse and disrepair.
                    </div>
                <div class="grid-item2 text"> The design team of landscape architects James Corner Field Operations and architecture firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro was selected to transform the High Line into a public park. Their design aimed to retain and incorporate the industrial character of the structure while introducing green spaces, pathways, seating areas, and public art installations.

It serves as a model for adaptive reuse and has revitalized the surrounding neighborhoods, attracting visitors.
                        The park expanded with the opening of additional sections, extending the High Line to its current length of approximately 1.45 miles (2.33 kilometers).

                    <div class="grid-item2 text"> Historically, the area where Hunter's Point South Park is now located was an industrial zone, characterized by factories, warehouses, and rail yards. It was primarily a manufacturing and shipping hub, with limited public access to the waterfront.
                        Alongside the industrial zones, there were residential areas where working-class families lived. These neighborhoods were home to local residents who worked in the nearby factories and industries. The housing stock consisted of rowhouses, tenements, and smaller apartment buildings.

The development of Hunter's Point South Park began in 2009, and it was a collaborative effort between various city agencies, including the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, the New York City Economic Development Corporation, and the Trust for Governors Island. The park was designed by landscape architecture firm Thomas Balsley Associates and architectural firm Weiss/Manfredi.

                    <div class="grid-item2 text"> In the late 20th century, with the decline of manufacturing and industrial activities in the city, many industrial sites in Long Island City fell into disuse. This period marked a transition from an industrial hub to a neighborhood with a mix of residential, commercial, and cultural uses. The redevelopment efforts aimed to repurpose former industrial sites and promote economic revitalization in the area.

                    <div class="text"> The presence of a park or green space in close proximity to a development can enhance the value of surrounding properties. People often prefer living near parks for the amenities they offer, such as recreational activities, green views, and a sense of community. This increased desirability can lead to higher property prices and better returns for developers.
                        A nonprofit looked at about 400,000 homes that had enough property tax data to evaluate. It estimated that about 5 percent of the value of those homes came from being within 500 feet of a local park — which Strickland said is a conservative figure because its previous research found increases of even 20 percent. The total market value of those properties was about $303 billion, according to the report.

                <div class="text"> Parks can serve as a unique selling point for developers, attracting potential buyers or tenants. Marketing a development as being located near a park or having easy access to green spaces can be an effective way to differentiate it from other properties in the market.

                <br>
                The revitalization of the neighborhood, driven by the development of the park and the surrounding commercial and residential projects, has raised concerns about gentrification. As property values rise and new luxury buildings are constructed, there is a potential for the displacement of lower-income residents and small businesses.

            <br>
            This shift in landscape and space management is not new. It is part of a larger trend of urban revitalization and the repurposing of underutilized spaces for public enjoyment.As we move towards more digital life and soft technology, the need for heavy duty factories have also reduced.

       <div class="grid-item1 subhead"  >Concluding</div>
                <div class="grid-item2 text"> This suggests that the creation of new parks, such as the exampes, can contribute to an increase in property values, potentially leading to affordability issues for existing residents in the surrounding neighborhoods
                    <br> However, this situation can be mitigated if affordable housing options are incorporated into the area prior to the construction of the new park and not after making it an uneven playing field.
                    <br> Implementing affordable housing measures alongside park development is a proactive approach to address the potential negative impact on housing affordability. It recognizes the importance of balancing the benefits of urban revitalization and park creation with the need to preserve socioeconomic diversity within the community.
                    <br> This also yet again re-intstate the fact that even a seemingly sustainable act of place-making might have nooks which are not visible and how projects in urban and commercial spaces are often motivated by long term benefits for developers or captalist agendas.
